## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Web Application Bundler
- [Embla Carousel](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) - Lightweight carousel library

### What I learned

It's been a while since I've worked on a project using Sass so I took this as an opportunity refresh my skills. The first thing I discover is that node-sass is deprecated and that folks should use Dart Sass instead. Once that issue was addressed, the next thing I needed to decide on was which tool should I use to compile SCSS to CSS. All my previous Sass experience was with using Gulp and I wanted to explore other options. This is how I came upon Parcel which turned out really easy to use.

### Continued development

One thing I've learned over my career is that while it's certainly possible to code your own solution for an image carousel/slider, there is no shame in using a library that will help make the implementation process easier. I've used Bootstrap, Owl Carousel, and Splide to implement carousel/sliders in past projects and I wanted to see what other options are out there. While I chose Embla Carousel for this project, I've read great things about Swiper and can't wait to try it in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell ](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell/featured) - Kevin Powell is such an awesome resource for all things CSS related.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - One of the best advice I ever received regarding web development is to always read the docs. ðŸ˜‰
